# cac_finalproject
This was the final project that I made for my first course in data analytics from "Codo a Codo Academy"

In this course we implement tools like Google Sheets, MySQL and Google Looker Studio to cleaned, processed and visualized the data we were given for
We could also get creatives in visualization part, adding color and complemented it we everything we could think to improve the engagement to the project

In my case I used a website to come up with the color palette and another website to add icons and some cartoonies draw to make it more visually appealing
This is a simple project with Data that I was giving for, I didn't have to collect it, transform it or scrapping it, so this project is just for you to see my skills in data cleaning, data visualization and critical thinking.

THANKS FOR READ ME!
